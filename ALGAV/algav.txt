6.3 Planning module
6.3.1 As an Admin, I want to obtain the better scheduling of a set of operations
(surgeries) in a certain operation room in a specific day.
The better scheduling is considered as the sequence of operations that finishes early. Note that
surgeries have constraints (e.g. number of doctors or other staff), namely concerning the time
availability of staff during the day. The approach may be generating all surgeries’ sequences and
select the better, and this is possible till a certain dimension (number of surgeries).
The user must have a user interface to start the process (enter any additional parameters the
planning algorithm needs, e.g., room number, date). The system will then generate the plan and
show it to the user on the screen. It is acceptable that the UI blocks while waiting for the planning
module response.
6.3.2 As an Admin, I want to know till what dimension in terms of number of surgeries
is possible to ask for the better solution.
Perform a complexity analysis of the problem to understand to which dimension it is feasible to
ask for the better solution. Document your results and findings.
6.3.3 As an Admin, I want to obtain a good schedule, not necessarily the better, in useful
time to be adopted.
The system generates a "good" (non-optimal but efficient) schedule using heuristics or informed
methods (e.g., greedy algorithms, rule-based scheduling).

The system prioritizes generating a schedule that is close to optimal but does so within a
reasonable time frame (e.g., under 30 seconds).
The user must have a user interface to start the process (enter any additional parameters the
planning algorithm needs, e.g., room number, date, which heuristic to use). The system will then
generate the plan and show it to the user on the screen. It is acceptable that the UI blocks while
waiting for the planning module response.
